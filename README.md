Question1: How many counties in the state of Washington remained storm free in 2007?

Answer: 3 counties.

Explanation:

I opened file 2007. Then organized the “state” tab by alphabet, choose Washington and copied it to the separate document. 
I then found the locations and checked with Wikipedia which area is what county. After excluding all the counties that were mentioned in the paper I figured that there are 4 left. Considering that I have to exclude counties that started with a vowel (Adams County), 3 left (Ferry County, Franklin county, Grays Harbor County, Stevens County), so the correct answer is: 3 counties were remained storm free in WA in 2007. 

Question2: How many wind based storms happened between 8AM PST and 11AM PST in 1957?

Answer: 100 

Explanation:

First of all, considering the 2 hours time difference between CST and PST I organized the file by time column from10 am – 1 pm.
Then I excluded lines with hail (since it is not a wind based type of storm). 
Then I excluded all states/marine locations starting with a vowel. Counted what left. 100 cases total.
