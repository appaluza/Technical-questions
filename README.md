Question1: How many counties in the state of Washington remained storm free in 2007?

Answer: 3 counties.

Explanation:
I opened file 2007. Then organized the “state” tab by alphabet, choose Washington and copied it to the separate document. 
I then found the locations and checked with Wikipedia which area is what county. After excluding all the counties that were mentioned in the paper I figured that there are 4 left. Considering that I have to exclude counties that started with a vowel (Adams County), 3 left (Ferry County, Franklin county, Grays Harbor County, Stevens County), so the correct answer is: 3 counties were remained storm free in WA in 2007.
